#	teleportAuto_minAggressives 6
#	teleportAuto_minAggressivesInLock 6
#
#	(mon_control.txt)
#	Hydra 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.2
#	Merman 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
#
#	If there's five hydras and two sword fish attacks the bot, it won't
#	teleport away since the aggressives are counted as 5*0.2 + 2*1 = 3
#	However, two marcs and two merman will make it tele away because
#	it sees 2*1* + 2*2 = 6 aggressives.
